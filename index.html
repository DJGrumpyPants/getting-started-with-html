  <h1>Things to Remember</h1><br>
<p>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
This is the main doccuemtn type of the web.  It can contain Text content, markups, and refrences<p>

<p>There are four pieces involved in browsing the internet:<br>
  1. Browsers - This is a program run on your local computer.  It conencts to remote sources and displays files from remote locations<br>
  2. The internet - This is the magical cloud of wires and conenctions that gets your browser to the servers.<br>
  3. 

Markups - these modify the way text appears on  the page.  Some to remember are:<br>
b = <b>Bold</b><br>
u = <u>underline</u><br>
br = line break<br>
p = paragraph<br>
em = <em>emphasis</em> (italics)<br>
a = anchor - an anchor is used with attributes such as href.<br><br>

Markups can be <b>inline</b> like br, or <b>block</b> like p.<br>

<b>Inline</b> markups modify a piece of text<br>
<b>Block</b> markups put a box around whatever is contained inside the marks.  <br>So a p (paragraph) would be contained inside a small box, and a piece of text that is made bold is inline.

<br><br>
<p><b>Computers are Stupid</b></p>
Remember that computers are stupid and can not make best guesses at what we want. <br> Exact instructions are key.
